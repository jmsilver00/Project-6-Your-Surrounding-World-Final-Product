The final aspect added was ambient lighting in the scene to have a deeper control of the colors and mood of the scene:

Sunrise

To run the program:

Ensure that the files roomscene.html, app.js, and gl-matrix.js are on your device in the same folder along with the attached jpegs. Then open roomscene.html in a WebGL friendly browser or from WebStorm.

You may need to run it on WebStrorm due to chromes Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), if it's not disabled in your browser which prevents the textures from working correctly.

I've just used the chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf/related?hl=en which lets me see the render straight from the html file.
